# Russian-Cybercrime-Correlation
My goal is to find a correlation between the volume of Russian ransomware attacks and a downturn in the Russian economy

Almost all other crime has a correlation to economic factors, however the research on this phenomenon and cyber crime is very sparse

I'm using 2 data sets: Russian Quarterly economic data (GDP, Oil Price, Exchange rate, inflation, etc) and Bitcoin Ransomware Attacks (I cut out only the Russian ransomware for this project).
